## Heyyyy there ðŸ‘‹

-( My name is Ella, But Ace is fine )-

"Hell is empty, all the devils are here" (Shakespeare)

Today is April 9. On the 11th I go to France (:

feeling: anxious, excited, nervous, content (:

I dont feel the need to share my favorite people anymore, I love all of my friends.

People i dislike: Just Bobby lol. he makes us do conditioning now -_-

things that annoy me: when people are too scraed to talk to me, boring books, when maverick gets my clothes dirty.
