## Heyyyy there ðŸ‘‹

"You're a different kind of beautiful.. the kind that makes me scared, the kind that makes me turn around and act like I'm not there, the kind that takes my breath away and leaves me without air, babe maybe I'm delusional, you're just that kind of BEAUTIFUL" (Different kind of beautiful - Alec Benjamin)

Today is April 9. On the 11th I go to France (:

feeling: anxious, excited, nervous, content (:

I dont feel the need to share my favorite people anymore, I love all of my friends.

People I dislike: Just Bobby lol. he makes us do conditioning now -_-

things that annoy me: when people are too scared to talk to me, boring books when Maverick gets my clothes dirty.
